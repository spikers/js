  <h1>Premise</h1>
  <p>What happens when a stop condition is called on a for-loop?</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It's pinged only once</li>
    <li>It's pinged every time</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Conclusion</h1>
  <p>It's pinged every time the loop executes. Interestly enough, it doesn't need to be bound. You literally need to call it. This is different from callbacks.</p>
